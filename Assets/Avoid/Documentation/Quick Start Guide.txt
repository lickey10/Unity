Full Unity documentation can be found at: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html

Code documentation and a detailed Read Me have been included in seperate files.

Reskin Guide:

Sprites are located in: Unity Project/Avoid/Assets/Avoid/Sprites/
Audio clips are located in: Unity Project/Avoid/Assets/Avoid/Audio

1) Ensure project is not open in Unity.
2) Find the sprite or audio clip you would like to replace in a file explorer. Use the above paths as reference.
3) Copy your file into the folder. Important: ensure your file has the same name as the one you would like to replace.
4) When asked if you would like to replace the file, select Yes. The file will be overwritten.

Ensure that your sprites have the same dimensions as the originals, otherwise objects may become distorted in the game and require you to manually scale objects in Unity.
