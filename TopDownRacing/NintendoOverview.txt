I am planning a 3d racing game. You are driving a miniature vehicle through huge environments like a classroom where the desktops and tabletops are the racetrack.  There are giant staplers, huge pens and pencils and massive computers and books among other things that you must avoid to get ahead of the competition.  Be sure to watch for the power ups and avoid traps as you speed and jump your way to victory. Along with the power ups you will have a choice of vehicles, like a sports car or a 4x4 truck, that will already have the ability to jump and boost when you need it. I want to use motion controls for steering and jumping.
